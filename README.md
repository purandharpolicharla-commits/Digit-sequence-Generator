Digit Sequence Generator

A simple and efficient Python program that generates a continuous sequence of digits from natural numbers and prints each digit along with its corresponding position based on a user-defined limit. This project is ideal for beginners learning digit extraction, loops, and number-processing logic in Python.
Features
Expands numbers (1–99 and beyond) into individual digits
Tracks and prints each digit with its sequence position
User-friendly input to define the digit limit
Demonstrates integer division, modulo operations, and control flow
🔧 Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or above
Steps
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/digit-sequence-generator.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
cd digit-sequence-generator
3. Run the script:
python digit_generator.py
How It Work
Numbers from 1 upward are iterated.
Each number is broken into digits using:
i // 10 → tens place
i % 10 → units place
Digits are printed until the user-specified limit is reached.
Code Overview
limit = int(input("Enter a number position: "))
count = 1
for i in range(1, 100): 
    if i < 10:
        if count <= limit:
            print(count, "th digit is", i)
            count += 1
    else:
        tens = i // 10
        units = i % 10

        if count <= limit:
            print(count, "th digit is", tens)
            count += 1
        if count <= limit:
            print(count, "th digit is", units)
            count += 1

 Example Output

Enter a number position: 8
1th digit is 1
2th digit is 2
3th digit is 3
4th digit is 4
5th digit is 5
6th digit is 6
7th digit is 7
8th digit is 8
